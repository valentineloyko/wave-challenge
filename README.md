### ðŸŒŸ What I'm Proud Of

I'm particularly proud of how the application balances accessibility, responsiveness, and performance.

In terms of performance, I implemented lazy loading to enhance loading times and optimize resource usage. On the state management side, I utilized Zustand for handling global state and React Query for managing server-side state, which ensures efficient data fetching and caching, resulting in a smoother user experience.
